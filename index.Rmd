## Conclusion

+ Ad delivery algorithms (unintentionally?) favor some political actors

--

+ Within-country price variation:
  + Average 4% (max. 27%)
  + Significant exposure bias leads to thousands of differential reach

--

+ Key drivers:
  + Audience size
  + Spending history
  + Ideology (?)
  + Supranational parties (?)

--

+ The shift toward algorithmic ad delivery demands new approaches to platform accountability

+ For effective regulation, we need to address ad delivery systems holistically, not just traditional targeting.

+ Algorithmic access for researchers to audit independently

### A Potential Solution? Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising (TTPA)

The European Parliament suggested:

<br>

> (47k) [...] **online platforms should not be allowed to selectively deliver political advertisement within the targeted potential audiences** based on further processing of personal data. 

> **The actual recipients of the political advertisement should therefore only be randomly selected by the publisher**, without any further processing of personal data.
